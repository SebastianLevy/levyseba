			My name is Sebastian Levy, and I am currently studying Mechanical Engineering at the University of Toronto. My main areas of focus are Mechatronics and Energy, two topics that have interested me all throughout my life. When I was 15, I built my first desktop PC, and while is was just a symptom of my affinity for technology rather than the cause, it really opened my eyes to the vast potentials of modern technology.

			Having been born in Chelsea, England, I spent my childhood living in Wimbledon, a suburb outside of London, mostly known for their successful adaptation of the very popular Wii Sports minigame, Tennis. At the age of 6, I moved to Canada, where I have lived in the city of Toronto ever since.
