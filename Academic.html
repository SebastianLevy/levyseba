			<ul>
				<li><a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1plAv6vh0-D84Ct6J4J8LOiCMngUxcnDm/view?usp=sharing">CT-241 Telephone Controller Application</a></li>
				<ul>
					<li>The CT-241 telephone controller is a device similar to Nest, in which one can remotely turn on or off lights, with the main difference being the telephone controller's use of the telephone line for the transmission of signals, instead of internet connections. When designing an application intended for making the CT-241 more comfortable to use, our primary focus was on the user-interface(UI). Our original design used an icon-based design with a dark blue background and bold, yellow text, but was eventually switched to a list-based design, featuring a pastel purple theme to deliver a clean yet informative graphical interface. Along with the UI, the design analyzed the technicality of forming the connection between the app and the controller.</li>

				<li><a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1PgKPPu45oUtEJ9dhS4nXuBT9QUeH3XlZ/view?usp=sharing">CNC Mill</a></li>
				<ul>
					<li>CNC Milling is the process of drilling and cutting material using programmed code that interprets instructions for specific movements to be carried out by the mill. The mill uses a rotating cylindrical drill bit to shape the material. As a design project, each member of our group took on various aspects of the design, mine being an alternate design. A belt gear design was used to move the cutting tool in x and y directions. Movement in the z-axis, which represents the drill moving up and down, was achieved using a stepper motor, allowing the mill complete axial design capabilities.</li>
				</ul>
				<li><a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1Tf_rouv6JxSn6kpkjENsmv1MwnSESgQE/view?usp=sharing">Tanvass Compass Application</a></li>
				<ul>
					<li>The Tanvas tablet, marketed as "the tablet you can feel," is a tablet that uses electrostatic interactions to control levels of friction on a screen. This tablet has seen significant breakthroughs through the use of haptic feedback, one of them being the possibility of helping the visually impaired. Our task was to design an application that took advantage of the Tanvas screen technology and can operate without any visual interface. Our application focused on the difficulties of navigation for the visually impaired and was a compass that allowed for user input, determining the direction of the needle. The reliance on a haptic user interface allows the application to be used by the visually impaired, without the need for screen readers, which fail to be useful in areas of extreme volume. </li>
