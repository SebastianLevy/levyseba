				Throughout my childhood, I have always had an interest in how electronics work and how they can be used. When I was nine, I tried to fix my Nintendo DS's broken top screen and noticed that the display cable had torn. After securing a replacement part, I opened up the hardware and replaced the wire. Even this small piece of electronic troubleshooting was enough to spark an interest in electronics. Six years later, I build my first computer, a task that came with many more troubleshooting opportunities, each of which interested me more and more. By the time university applications came around, the decision to go into engineering was obvious to me. While I was deciding between Mechanical and Electrical, I decided to go into mechanical engineering due to the broader range of opportunities and my affinity for cars. I have always been looking to the future, which is why Energy and the Environment have been one of the focuses of my undergraduate degree, as climate change is one of the biggest problems the human race currently faces. The purpose of my engineering degree is to use my engineering knowledge to design solutions to climate change through an emphasis on robotics, hence my specialization in mechatronics within my undergraduate degree.

				As the world moves into a digital age, humans' potential grows every day, however, so does our effect on the planet. While many choose to deny the impact of pollution and the theory of climate change, the science behind it tells a worrying story. An engineer's role in the twenty-first century is to provide solutions to problems while accounting for the impact these solutions will have on the environment. This accountability has been one of the main focuses of my engineering schooling and has given me an insight into what needs to be done to provide future generations with a clean, safe environment to prosper. While accountability for the environment is a large part of an engineer's duties, there are many more attributes that an engineer should follow. Acknowledgment of these graduate attributes helps create well-rounded engineers with respect for themselves and those around them. While being aware of all these attributes throughout my graduate degree, I have focused on the two that I believe I represent best, individual and teamwork and economics and project management.

				Teamwork has been vital to humanity's history, even being an evolutionary trait humans have adopted for survival. This application of collaboration is no different in the form of engineering. As such, the ability to work in teams and the ability to complete the individual work required of you within these teams is paramount to the concept of engineering. While many say that a problem shared is a problem halved, the ability to bounce ideas off of one another much more than halves the problem and can even make it seem trivial in comparison. As such, the attribute of teamwork could not be complete without the inclusion of effective communication. Due to this importance, much of my undergraduate degree has focused on teamwork, and in many group projects, I have taken on the role of project manager. While I have struggled with showing initiative in the past, the accountability presented through a group project increases my organization and allows me to work on my proactiveness. These improvements to my organization and initiative have additionally helped my leadership and confidence in managing projects.

				While leadership and organization can be indispensable in engineering project management, awareness of the project's economic side must also be considered. That is why the attribute of economic and project management focuses on both aspects. Every engineering project must take risk, profit, and societal effect into account no matter the context. If these are ignored, the project likely won't receive the funding necessary and dissuade investors from a potential idea due to lack of due diligence. Additionally, every engineering project has an effect on the economy, and it is an engineer's duty to do anything in their power to promote equality and inclusivity. That is why affordability must be taken into account in any engineering project, and the economic effect on society must be similarly studied.
